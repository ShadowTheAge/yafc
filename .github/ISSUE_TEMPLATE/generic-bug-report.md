- Make sure that you are using the latest available version of YAFC.
- Specify the YAFC version on which the bug happened.

- Check the issues of [this](https://github.com/have-fun-was-taken/yafc-ce/issues) and the [original](https://github.com/ShadowTheAge/yafc/issues) repository for at least 5 minutes to see if your problem is not a duplicate of another open or closed issue.
- Give as much relevant info as possible. The better you describe the issue, the bigger the chance someone fixes it. 
- If the bug is about mods, attach a new-game save-file so we can sync the mods with yours.
- If the bug is about your .yafc project, such as errors in calculations, then attach your .yafc file.
- Describe the steps to reproduce the issue, the expected result, and the actual result.
- If possible, please provide a minimal example to reproduce the issue. For example, check if the bug can be reproduced on a fresh project instead of the usual one. Try to use as few mods as possible.
