# YAFC: Community Edition
### Why new repo?
The [original](https://github.com/ShadowTheAge/yafc) YAFC repository has been inactive for years. Bugfixes piled up, but there was no one to review and merge them. This repository aims to solve that problem.

### Have you talked with the author?
Yes, we have their approval.

## What is YAFC?
Yet Another Factorio Calculator, or YAFC, is a Factorio calculator, planner and analyser. The main goal of YAFC is to help with heavily modded games.

YAFC is more than just a calculator. It contains multiple analysis algorithms and tries to understand what is going on in your modpack. These analyses go as deep as trying to estimate the amount of ores generated by the map generator, and as wide as calculating late-game base trying to figure how much of everything you are going to need. It knows which items are important and which are less important, which recipes are efficient and which are less efficient.

I started working with YAFC when other tools (such as Helmod) failed to work with deeply recursive Pyanodon recipes. YAFC handles recursive recipes extremely well, it uses [Google OrTools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) as its model solver.

YAFC also includes several tools, the most important currently is "Never Enough Items" - it is FNEI on steroids, showing not only recipes to produce or consume an item, but also which recipes you probably want to use, and how much.

## Project features
- Work with modded games, any mod combination. 
- Multiple analyses:
    - Accessibility analysis: YAFC shows objects that are not accessible. Mods are often hiding objects, and factorio has a bunch of hidden objects (for example campaign entities). Unfortunately it is impossible to find out objects that are spawned by mod or map scripts, this analysis may fail for modpacks like seablock. However, you can mark some objects as accessible manually.
    - Milestone analysis: You can add anything (Item, Fluid, Recipe, Technology, etc) as a milestone. YAFC will display that milestone icon on every object that is locked behind it, directly or indirectly. Science packs are natural milestones, and so they are added by default.
    - Automation analysis: YAFC tries to find objects that can be fully automated. For example, wood in a vanilla game cannot be fully automated because it requires you (or bots) to cut trees.
    - Cost analysis: YAFC assigns a "cost" to each object. "Cost" is a sum of "logistic" actions you need to perform to get that object, using the most optimal recipes. YAFC cost is very useful to compare items/recipes/etc at a glance, it is also useful for many heuristics. Also this cost helps to find which recipes are sub-optimal.
    - Flow analysis: YAFC calculates a base that produces enough science packs for all non-infinite research. So it figures out how much of everything you will probably need
- Dependency explorer tool that allows you to explore dependency graph - ie which objects are needed for what. It can also help debug Milestone, Automation and Automation analyses (find out why YAFC thinks that some object is not accessible for example)
- Never Enough Items Explorer tool that helps to find out how you can produce any item, and also which way YAFC thinks is optimal.
- Main calculator sheet:
    - Setting up links: YAFC will try to balance production/consumption only for linked goods. Unlinked goods are calculated, but no attempt to balance is made. This is a very important difference from Helmod that tries to balance everything that has production and consumption, often resulting in infeasible model on deeply recursive recipes.
    - Nested sheets: You can add a nested sheet attached to any recipe. When collapsed, you will see a summary (all ingredients/products) for all recipes in the sheet. Nested sheets also have their own set of links. For example, you can create a nested sheet for electronic circuits, and put copper cables production inside that sheet. If you add an internal link for copper cables, it will be separate (so you can calculate separate copper cables for electronic circuits)
    - Auto modules: You can add modules to recipes by using a single slider. It will automatically add modules you have access to (based on milestones), and it will prioritize putting modules into buildings that benefit the most from them. There is a cool gif of this in action later.
    - Limited support for fluid temperature (without mixing different temperatures) allows to calculate energy generation
    - Fuel (including electricity) is also part of the calculation - you can even add energy generation exactly enough for your sheet (Inserters are not counted though)
- Supports Factorio versions 0.17+
- Multiple pages
- Undo (ctrl+Z)

## Possible incompatibilities

YAFC loads mods in an environment that is not 100% compatible with Factorio. I have tested YAFC with some of the most popular mods, but mods are changing and Factorio is changing.
- You (or I) can write mod-specific fixes in lua
- Another way of loading data (directly from the game), is in possible plans
- Anyway, report mods incompatibilities and other bugs in [the issues section](https://github.com/ShadowTheAge/yafc/issues)

> I am playing Seablock / Other "scripted progression" mod and YAFC thinks that items are inaccessible

I don't know any nice solution for this, but you can open *Dependency explorer* and manually mark a bunch of items as accessible (And also starting technologies for Seablock for example)

For Seablock specifically, check [this issue](https://github.com/ShadowTheAge/yafc/issues/31) that contains small list of things to enable at first.

For mod authors: You can detect YAFC by checking `data.data_crawler` variable during the data stage. It will be equal to `yafc a.b.c.d` where `a.b.c.d` is yafc version (e.g. `yafc 0.5.4.0`)
	
## **[Download YAFC](https://github.com/ShadowTheAge/yafc/releases)**

YAFC is a desktop app. Windows build is the most tested, however OSX and Linux builds also exist. For those OS see [Linux and OSX installation instructions](/Docs/LinuxOsxInstall.md)
