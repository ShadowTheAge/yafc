Version: 0.7.1
Date: soon
    Features:
        - Allow configuring the size of icons that have backgrounds, since the icon may cover the entire
          background area.
    Changes:
        - Update the detection of special recipes and items, to detect stacking from Deadlock's Beltboxes, caging
          from Pyanodon, and pressurization from Pressurized Fluids.
          Also detect cases where one direction is required, (e.g. Some Nullius science packs are manufactured in
          stacks) and do not consider the required recipe special. (The unstacking recipe, in this case)
          As before, special items/recipes are shown at the end of lists and are not selected when ctrl-clicking.
    Fixes:
        - Display spent fuel items in the production table and link summaries.
        - Fix error when switching items in NEIE with middle-click
        - Fix an exception when hovering over recipes in certain pathological cases.

Version: 0.7.0
Date: May 25th 2024
    Features:
        - Add the option to specify a number of belts of production, and to specify per-second/minute/hour
          production regardless of the current display setting.
        - When searching in the page list, allow searching in page contents as well as in page names.
        - Allow the user to select whether catalysts should be considered produced and consumed by the recipes that
          use them. (e.g. Does coal liquefaction consume heavy oil?)
    Changes:
        - Add a help message and proper handling for command line arguments
        - Removed default pollution cost from calculation. Added a setting to customize pollution cost.
        - Add fuel consumption recipe for products

        - The Release Candidates (RC) bring confusion to versioning, so they are no longer used.
